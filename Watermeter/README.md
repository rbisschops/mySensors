mySensors Watermeter

Adapted mySensors Arduino sketch for measuring pulses on a (standard) household watermeter.

The development was initially done for a Itron Aquadis+ watermeter, but can be dapted for any other watermeter that has te ability to read one of the rotating counters externally.

For more info and dicussion on this project, visit the [mySensors forum thread ](http://forum.mysensors.org/topic/2522/water-meter-itron-aquadis-with-pulse-sensor).

You can find the hardware design also on [openhardware.io](https://www.openhardware.io/view/15/Itron-Aquadis-watermeter-sensor)
